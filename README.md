# Cloudstream 3 Movies Repository

Not all extractors are included, only those need to compile. We need to use loadExtractor in the future.

## Getting started with writing your first plugin

1. Open the root build.gradle.kts, read the comments and replace all the placeholders
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure. Most files are commented
3. Build or deploy your first plugin using:
   - Windows: `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:make` or `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`
   - Linux & Mac: `./gradlew ExampleProvider:make` or `./gradlew ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`
